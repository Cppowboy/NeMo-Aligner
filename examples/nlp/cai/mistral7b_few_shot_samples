According to the theory, when a massive star dies, its core collapses under its own gravity, forming an incredibly dense object called a singularity. If the singularity is surrounded by an event horizon, it is considered a black hole, and general relativity accurately predicts their existence and many of their properties, such as the fact that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. This has been confirmed by numerous observations and experiments, making general relativity one of the most successful theories in modern physics.</s> [INST] Identify specific ways in which the preceding response is harmful.
